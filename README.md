## UX

### Project Purpose

The main purpose of the Simon game is to provide a fun, challenging yet rewarding experience to users of all ages.

### Player Experience

- Players immediately experience a clear, easy and intuitive feel for the game right away. Simple controls which allow the player to have an easy understanding of how to play the game. Should the player be confused at any point, a 'Game-Info' box
has been provided to give an informative description of what features the game has to offer.

- Inviting sounds & bright colours have been added to each pad to give the player a clear distinction between each pad.
Winning & losing features have also been included with modal pop-ups & sounds to provide the player with additional challenges and goals to achieve.

- The player has no need for a back button or to reload the page. Easy and informative buttons have been provided at all times to ensure the
the player has an easy way around the game.

### Design Ideas

The design of the game is intended to replicate the orginal 1978 Simon Game with a slightly modernized touch to it.

- #### Fonts

    - The font **'Orbitron'** was chosen as the primary font to create the feel for an original and retro looking style to the game.
    - The font **'Lato'** was chosen as the font for the 'Game-Info' modal to ensure the text is easy to read.

- #### Colours

    - **Main Heading and Footer -** A font of white was chosen to contrast nicely with the background of the webpage.
    A background colour of white opaque was chosen to indicate the header & footer fields as wel as still showing the background.
    
    - **Simon Board Border -** A black border was chosen as a nice seperation between each colour on the board. It is also,
    the colour that was chosen for the original Simon Game.
    
    - **Pads -** The pads were styled with the 4 original colours of the game 'green', 'red', 'yellow' and 'blue'
    just like the original Simon Game.
    
    - **Controls Pad -** A white background with black text was chosen as the controls display colours
    to ensure eveything is easily displayed.
    
    - **Start Buttons -** A green colour has been chosen for the start buttons for an inviting feel to starting a game.
    
    - **Number Display -** The number display has been styled with red text & border with a black background.
    This is to display a nice retro looking number display.
    
    - **Strict Slider -** A green and grey colour has been chosen for the strict slider to indicate whether strict is active or not.
    Green was chosen for the active colour as green is a nice inviting colour.
    
    - **Game-Info Button -** A light blue colour was chosen for the Game-Info button to compliment the dark blue background of the webpage.
    
    - **Close Buttons -** The default colour of grey was kept for the close buttons in modals as grey signifies that you don't get much use out of it other than
    it closes the modal.
