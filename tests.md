## Automated Testing

### Validating Code

Validation services were used to ensure that code was valid code used to develop the website.

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test HTML code to ensure it was valid code.
- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to test CSS code to ensure it was valid code.
- [Code Beautify JavaScript Validator](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate) was used to test CSS code to ensure it was valid code.

### Jasmine Testing

As this was the first time using JavaScript and Jasmine testing, I thought it would be better to write my
JavaScript first and then run Jasmine testing afterwards as learning the two simultaneously would have been
very difficult to do. So I began by manually testing my JavaScript through the console and then using
Jasmine testing to ensure tests were passing.

I tested using Jasmine, taking it one step at a time. I would get my tests to first fail and then get them to
pass to ensure they were working as they should be working. I generated a nice chunk of testing.

My Intention is to learn more about Jasmine testing and the uses you can get out of it so I can incorporate
extra testing in the future.

Files used for Jasmine testing:

- The HTML page where all of the Jasmine testing tools are stored: [**jasmine.html**](assets/jasmine-testing/jasmine.html)
- The JavaScript spec where the tests are run: [**simonSpec.js**](assets/jasmine-testing/spec/simonSpec.js)
- The JavaScript code being tested: [**simon.js**](assets/js/simon.js)
